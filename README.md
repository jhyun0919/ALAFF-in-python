Advanced Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers (ALAFF) in Python ver.

As a UT student who took the **"Advanced Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers (ALAFF)"** course by **Dr. Robert van de Geijn** and **Dr. Maggie Myers** in the Fall 2020 semester, I would like to say thank you for introducing me great insight into Numerical Analysis in Linear Algebra.

However, all the exercises were written in MATLAB, and as a python lover, I would like to re-write the codes in python. I hope this will not only help me review the content of the course but also help students who are more comfortable with python and studying this subject in the future.

All the contents to be covered in this repository refer to the following repository.
